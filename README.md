# 1030_Project

This repository contains Python code, data, figures, and reports for my DATA 1030 Project at Brown University. 

This project is about to predict the ratings of Sephora products. I use 5 different machine learning models to make predictions with group 5-fold cross validation. 

The final report contains following sections:
- Introduction
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Methods
- Results
- Outlook
- References

I use Python version 3.7.3 with the following packages:
- pandas 0.25.0
- numpy 1.17.1
- sklearn 0.21.3
- matplotlib 3.1.1

The original data set is in the data folder. All tables and plots are in the figures folder. Reports are in the reports folder. The final model is in the results folder. All source code (ipython notebooks) are in the src folder. There is a LICENSE file indicating what you can and cannot do with the code.
